# Hackithon_2023

This project aims to analyze and classify ABP (Arterial Blood Preasure) waveforms using advanced machine learning techniques. Specifically, we use deep learning models, such as LSTM networks, to recognize patterns within waveform data and make predictions. The main focus is to identify and mark anomalous segments within the waveform data.

## How It Works

### 1. `ai2.py` - Model Training
This script is responsible for training our LSTM model using labeled waveform data. The LSTM architecture is chosen due to its prowess in handling sequential data like waveforms.

**Steps:**
- Load and preprocess the waveform data.
- Define the LSTM model architecture.
- Train the model on the data.
- Save the model weights for later use.

### 2. `ai2test.py` - Model Testing
In this script, we test the performance of our trained model on a test dataset.

**Steps:**
- Load and preprocess the test data.
- Load the pre-trained LSTM model.
- Make predictions on the test data.
- Compare predictions with true labels to calculate performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### 3. `ai2validate.py` - Model Validation and Fine-Tuning
This script is used to validate and fine-tune the model using a validation dataset. Fine-tuning is done using techniques like transfer learning.

**Steps:**
- Load and preprocess the validation data.
- Load the pre-trained LSTM model.
- Use early stopping and optionally unfreeze some layers for fine-tuning.
- Train the model on the validation data.
- Evaluate its performance.

## Flask Web Interface
We also provide a Flask-based web interface to visualize the waveform data and the model's predictions. This interface allows users to see the model's decisions on different segments of the waveform and will provide the options for manual corrections.

## Key Concepts

1. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) Networks**: A type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequential data. It can remember patterns over long sequences and is less susceptible to the vanishing gradient problem compared to vanilla RNNs.

2. **Transfer Learning**: A machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a way to take advantage of the knowledge gained while solving one problem and applying it to a different but related problem.

3. **Early Stopping**: A regularization method where the training process is halted once a certain condition is met. It's used to avoid overfitting on the training data.
